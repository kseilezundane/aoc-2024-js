# Advent Of Code 2024 solutions in JavaScript (aoc-2024-js)

This repository contains solutions of [2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) Advent Of Code tasks written
in JavaScript.

I use a few Node.js functions, e.g., to read the input. The rest of the code is written in JavaScript.

If you randomly stumble upon this repo and have any comments on my code -
make sure to send me your suggestions as I am always happy to receive feedback
to improve myself.

Merry Christmas and Happy New 2025 year! :)

P.S. If I skip or solve some days later, please don't be mad andkeep in mind that I've just 
switched jobs and I'm working really hard to prove myself during the probation period. :D
